# Pathfinding Visualization Project

## What is pathfinding?

Pathfinding or pathing is the plotting, by a computer application, of the shortest route between two points.

## What is this project?

This project is based on React. It visualizes how a pathfinding algorithm works and how an algorithm finds the shortest path between two points using a web application.

For now, I've implemented only three algorithms: Dijkstra, Breath First Search, and Death First Search.
