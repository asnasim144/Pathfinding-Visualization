# Pathfinding Visualization Project

## Overview
This project is built with React to visualize how a pathfinding algorithm works to find the shortest route between two points. Pathfinding, also known as pathing, is the process of finding the shortest route between two points using a computer algorithm.

Currently, the project includes the implementation of three algorithms: Dijkstra, Breadth First Search, and Depth First Search. Visit the [project website](https://asnasim144.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualization/) to see it in action.

## Features
With this web application, you can:
- Visualize any of the three implemented algorithms
- Change the position of the start and end nodes
- Create and remove walls

## Usage
To use this application, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right corner of this page.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the app by running `npm start`.
5. The app should now be running at http://localhost:3000/.

## Customizing the App
To customize the app for your own project, follow these steps:
